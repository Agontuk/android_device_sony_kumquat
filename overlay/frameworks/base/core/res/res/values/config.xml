    <!-- Array of light sensor LUX values to define our levels for auto backlight brightness support.
         The N entries of this array define N + 1 control points as follows:
         (1-based arrays)

         Point 1:            (0, value[1]):             lux <= 0
         Point 2:     (level[1], value[2]):  0        < lux <= level[1]
         Point 3:     (level[2], value[3]):  level[2] < lux <= level[3]
         ...
         Point N+1: (level[N], value[N+1]):  level[N] < lux

         The control points must be strictly increasing.  Each control point
         corresponds to an entry in the brightness backlight values arrays.
         For example, if LUX == level[1] (first element of the levels array)
         then the brightness will be determined by value[2] (second element
         of the brightness values array).

         Spline interpolation is used to determine the auto-brightness
         backlight values for LUX levels between these control points.

         * The WiFi radio must support concurrent connections to the WiFi display and
           to an access point.
         * The Audio Flinger audio_policy.conf file must specify a rule for the "r_submix"
           remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
           audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
         * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.
         * The device must be provisioned with HDCP keys (for protected content).
